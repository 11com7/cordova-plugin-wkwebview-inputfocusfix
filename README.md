# THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED!

This plugin was introduced as a temporary fix for the input focusing issue raised on main WKWebView repositories of Apache and Ionic. As the changes are merged to the main repositories - https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/37/ and https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/171, the plugin is deprecated and has no effect on fixing any focus issues anymore. 

## If you're facing issues with the input focusing, simply upgrade your wkwebview cordova plugin to it's latest version. And if your issue still exists after the upgrade, open an issue on the main wkwebview cordova repo: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/issues.
