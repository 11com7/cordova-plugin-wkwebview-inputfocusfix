# THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED!

This plugin was introduced as a temporary fix for the input focusing issue raised on main WKWebView repositories of Apache and Ionic. As the changes are merged to the main repositories - https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/37/ and https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/pull/171, the plugin is deprecated and has no effect on fixing any focus issues anymore. 

Please don't depend on cordova-plugin-wkwebview-inputfocusfix package.
